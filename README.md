# UAV-Application-of-Human-Detection-and-Dynamic-Target-Tracking-Using-YOLOv8-

Surveillance Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become a critical asset in various fields due to their adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to deliver rapid, real-time data across a multitude of applications. This paper explores the integration of UAV technology with deep learning algorithms, particularly focusing on real-time human detection using the YOLOv8 model. Leveraging a custom-built database, a UAV equipped with a Raspberry Pi 5 is deployed to perform not only human detection but also dynamic target tracking, ensuring a consistent distance between the drone and the target. The proposed system is specifically optimized for applications that demand precise and continuous monitoring, such as search and rescue operations. The study demonstrates that the YOLOv8 architecture offers significant improvements in detection accuracy and processing time with results of 99% precision, pushing the boundaries of UAV applications in real-time human detection.
